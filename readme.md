# My neovim config
- Just clone it to your nvim config folder (~/Appdata/Local/nvim in windows), and should work right away!!
- Python and clangd required for autocompletion
- Nodejs for markdown preview

## Refrences
Highly inspired from this [config](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/nvim). It's almost same with few exceptions.
